# StatusBar for Cordova

Change the style of the status bar in iOS, in any instance of your app. You can show it, hide it, change the tint to white or black. All transitions are animated. <strong>Cordova 3.+ compatible.</strong>

## Installation

1. run 'cordova plugin add https://github.com/patrickheneise/cordova-ios-statusbar.git'
2. In Xcode 5 edit your app plist file set "View controller-based status bar appearance" to NO

##How it works

    statusbar = navigator.statusBar;
    statusbar.hide();
    statusbar.show();
    statusbar.whiteTint();
    statusbar.blackTint();

It's as simple as that. Have fun.
